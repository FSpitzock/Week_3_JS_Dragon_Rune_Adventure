# üê≤ Capstone Project: Rune of Chance!

## Goal

Build a production-ready interactive web application that lets users create a character (dragon or human), make choices, collect runes, and track their progress using all the JavaScript skills you‚Äôve learned in this module. This project will help you demonstrate your understanding of variables, data types, arrays, objects, functions, constructors, ES6 features, user input, and more.

---

## Problem

You need to design and implement a complete JavaScript project from scratch. The application must:
- Collect user input (name, species, rune choices) using `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm`.
- Validate and process user input, giving feedback and updating the game state.
- Use arrays, objects, constructors, and ES6+ features to manage data and logic.
- Display and log the user‚Äôs progress and stats.
- Handle user choices, random outcomes, and win/lose conditions.
- Be visually appealing and easy to use.

## Solution (Agile Approach)

### 1. **Plan (Sprint 1)**
- **Break down the project:** List all features and requirements.
- **Sketch your UI:** Decide what the user will see and how they will interact.
- **Set up your project structure:** Create folders and files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`).

### 2. **Build Core Features (Sprint 2)**
- **Character Creation:** Use `prompt` to get the user‚Äôs name and species.
- **Rune Choices:** Present two rune options using `prompt` and randomly determine the correct one.
- **Feedback:** Use `alert` and `confirm` to give feedback and ask if the user wants to continue.
- **XP and Collection:** Track XP and runes in arrays/objects. Update stats based on choices.

### 3. **Enhance and Refactor (Sprint 3)**
- **Use Constructors/Classes:** Create a `Player` class or constructor.
- **Use ES6 Features:** Implement arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and more.
- **Add Loops and Conditionals:** Use loops for repeated actions and `if/else` for logic.
- **Log Progress:** Use `console.log()` to track the game state and user actions.

### 4. **Polish and Test (Sprint 4)**
- **Style your app:** Use CSS to make your project visually appealing.
- **Test all features:** Try different inputs and edge cases.
- **Refactor code:** Make your code clean, readable, and well-commented.
- **Document:** Write clear instructions in your README.

### 5. **Reflect and Share (Sprint 5)**
- **Review your work:** What went well? What was challenging?
- **Share your project:** Demo your app to classmates or upload to GitHub.

## Tips

- Work in small increments and test as you go.
- Use comments to explain your logic.
- Collaborate with classmates if possible and use version control (Git/GitHub).
- Don‚Äôt be afraid to research and try new things!
